                                exercise, helps
                                develop stamina. It
                                can also
                                improve the functioning of the heart and lungs. Another benefit of endurance exercise is
                                an
                                increase in the body's metabolic rate, which helps a person burn calories long after
                                their
                                workout is complete and assist in a person's body-reshaping efforts.
                                Endurance exercise not only boosts a person's physical health -- it might also increase
                                mental functioning. When a person performs an endurance exercise, their brain releases
                                endorphins. Endorphins are the body's natural pain reliever and feel-good hormone.
                                According
                                to the study "Effects of Exercise," conducted by Dinas, Flouris and Koutedakis, those
                                who
                                participated in endurance exercise experienced a lower instance of developing symptoms
                                of
                                depression thanks to experienced elevated levels of endorphin released during and after
                                activity.

                                Endurance training is essential for a variety of endurance sports. A notable example is
                                distance
                                running events.Two other popular examples are cycling and competitive swimming. Athletes
                                can
                                also undergo endurance training when their sport may not necessarily be an endurance

                                Fundamental for endurance training is supercompensation. Supercompensation describes the
                                adaptation of muscles on a previous stimulus over time.Long-term endurance training
                                induces
                                many
                                physiological adaptations both centrally and peripherally mediated. Central

                                adaptations include decreased heart rate, increased stroke volume of the heart

                                resistance training, causes contractions of the muscles via external resistance. The

                                can come from using barbells, dumbbells, resistance bands, strength machines or a

                                Strength training forms tiny, microscopic tears in a person's muscles. As the tears heal
