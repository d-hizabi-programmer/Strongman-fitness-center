                                exercise, helps
                                develop stamina. It
                                can also
                                improve the functioning of the heart and lungs. Another benefit of endurance exercise is

                                Endurance exercise not only boosts a person's physical health -- it might also increase
                                mental functioning. When a person performs an endurance exercise, their brain releases
                                endorphins. Endorphins are the body's natural pain reliever and feel-good hormone.
                                According
                                to the study "Effects of Exercise," conducted by Dinas, Flouris and Koutedakis, those

                                Endurance training is essential for a variety of endurance sports. A notable example is
                                distance
                                running events.Two other popular examples are cycling and competitive swimming. Athletes
                                can
                                also undergo endurance training when their sport may not necessarily be an endurance

                                Fundamental for endurance training is supercompensation. Supercompensation describes the
                                adaptation of muscles on a previous stimulus over time.Long-term endurance training
                                induces

                                resistance training, causes contractions of the muscles via external resistance. The
                                resistance
                                can come from using barbells, dumbbells, resistance bands, strength machines or a

                                Strength training forms tiny, microscopic tears in a person's muscles. As the tears heal

                                muscles repair themselves with new muscle tissue. By developing new muscle tissue, an
                                individual
                                can improve their aesthetic appearance and transform their physique to make it leaner

                                toned.
                                Strength training or resistance training involves the performance of physical exercises
                                which are designed to improve strength and endurance. It is often associated with the
                                use of weights. It can also incorporate a variety of training techniques such as
                                calisthenics, isometrics, and plyometrics.

                                <strong>Increased physical attractiveness:</strong>
                                Many people take up strength training to improve their physical attractiveness. There is
                                evidence that a body type consisting of broad shoulders and a narrow waist, attainable
                                through strength training, is the most physically attractive male attribute according to
                                women participating in the research.

                                Strength training also provides functional benefits. Stronger muscles improve posture,
                                provide better support for joints, and reduce the risk of injury from everyday
                                activities. Older people who take up weight training can prevent some of the loss of
                                muscle tissue that normally accompanies aging—and even regain some functional
                                strength—and by doing so become less frail.

                                    <strong> Dumbbell Training </strong> <br>
                                    By definition, a dumbbell is a short bar with a weight at either end. Sometimes they
                                    come wrapped in different materials or even feature adjustable dials, but the core
                                    concept has been the same for centuries. Speaking of which, the forebearers of these
                                    nifty hand weights date as far back as ancient Greece.

                                    You can find dumbbells that weigh as little as 1 pound and as much as 375 pounds.
                                    That said, most dumbbells fall within the range of 5-25 pounds. At the nearest gym,
                                    the heaviest dumbbell usually weighs in at around 60 pounds. If you’re looking for
                                    anything heavier, you should be going to one of those special gyms because you’re a

                                    <strong>Kettlebell Training</strong> <br>
                                    Kettlebells are cast iron weights ranging from 5 lbs to over 100 lbs, shaped like a
                                    ball with a handle for easy gripping.

                                    The kettlebell originated in Russia and was popular in the U.S. decades ago, but has
                                    hit a resurgence in the last few years with a flurry of classes, videos, and books.
                                    The reason? Kettlebells offer a different kind of training using dynamic moves
                                    targeting almost every aspect of fitness—endurance, strength, balance, agility and
                                    cardio endurance. People love it because it's challenging, efficient and you only
                                    need one piece of equipment.

                                    The idea is to hold the kettlebell in one or both hands and go through a variety of
                                    exercises like the two arm swing, the snatch, the loaded carry, and the high pull.

                                    A barbell is a piece of exercise equipment used in weight training, bodybuilding,
                                    weightlifting and powerlifting, consisting of a long bar, usually with weights
                                    attached at each end.

                                    Keep the barbell close to your body and pull it straight up toward your chest,
                                    bending your elbows as you do, so that they go just past your torso. Squeeze your
                                    shoulder blades at the top of the movement. Slowly straighten your arms to lower the
                                    bar, keeping it off the floor. This is 1 rep.

                                    men start with a set of two 10- to 20-pound weights. How to: Stand with a weight in
                                    each hand, near hips, palms forward. Shoulders and elbows should be pinned against
